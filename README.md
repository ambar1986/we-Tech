By 2020, 1.4 million jobs will open in computer science. Yet, according to a recent article from TechCrunch, only 29% of graduates will be qualified to fill those positions - and less than 3% will be filled by women. This is a serious domestic issue that we are hoping to tackle.

Since the 1980s, women in computer science have dropped from 37% to less than 18% today. Studies have shown that aptitude isn't the problem, it's the culture. The male-dominated field and the lack of female role models have made the industry unappealing to women.

WeTech is a mentorship program that matches women pursuing a career in technology with a mentor who is currently working in the industry and can provide guidance and advice.
